## Branching Strategy
Branching gives you an extra layer to do version control on, and allows you to maintain the integrity of your master branch. <br />
My branching strategy is the git flow branching strategy and can be seen in the diagram below.

I will isolate my work into 5 different branches to exercise flow control. <br />

✔️ Main <br />
✔️ Develop <br />
✔️ Feature <br />
✔️ Release <br />
✔️ Hotfit <br />

When working on a personal project it is not always necessary to have this many branshes. Once I start working on my other projects, I may decide to change this branching strategy; however, I intend to keep this branching strategy with the idea of preparing myself for the real world where I will be working in a team that requires many branches before being able to push work directly to the main (production) branch. 

## The use of .gitnore
The reason for a gitignore file is because there are certain items in your project that you dont necessarily want published to your repository.These items could be credentials or files giving access to your databases and so forth. 
Add the path of the file that you want to ignore into the .gitnore text file.
Usually when using visual studio the .vs file should be added to the .gitnore file.
