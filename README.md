## Branching Strategies

## The use of .gitnore
The reason for a gitignore file is because there are certain items in your project that you dont necessarily want published to your repository.These items could be credentials or files giving access to your databases and so forth. 
Add the path of the file that you want to ignore into the .gitnore text file.
Usually when using visual studio the .vs file should be added to the .gitnore file.
